Landing Page Review – Portfolio

This landing page is fully built and responsive. All main sections are implemented: hero, features, call-to-action, and footer.

Good things:

Works on desktop and mobile.

Buttons, modals, burger menu, and scroll-top work fine.

Clean HTML structure and organized SCSS.

Custom 404 page works and has back navigation.

Things to improve:

Some JS in main.js may break on pages without certain elements.

Could add small animations or hover effects for more interaction.

Images can be optimized for faster loading.

Accessibility and SEO can be improved (ARIA labels, meta tags).

Summary:
The page is visually nice and functional. Ready for portfolio or demo, with minor improvements possible.
